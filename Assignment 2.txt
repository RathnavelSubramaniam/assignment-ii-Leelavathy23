Question 1:Sort flights to find the fastest flights

  Answer: arr_time is used to find the fastest flights. dep_delay if arranged in desc also used to find the fastest flights.

```{r}
arrange(flights,arr_time | air_time)
```

Question 2:	Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

  Answer: dep_time and sched_dep_time are in the format time. Their difference is given in dep_delay.
```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay)

```
Question 3:	Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:

a.A 15 minutes early 50% of flight is the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
b.A flight is always 10 minutes late.
c.A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
d.99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it’s 2 hours late.

  Answer: Arrival delay is more important than departure delay.

```{r}

```

Question 4:	Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?
    Answer: The plane with tailnum N384HA has the worst on time-record.

```{r}
arrange(flights,desc(arr_delay),desc(dep_delay))

```

Question 5: Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
```{r}
select(flights,dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```
```{r}
select(flights,"dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
```
```{r}
select(flights,4,6,7,9)
```
```{r}
select(flights,starts_with("dep_"),starts_with("arr_"))
```
```{r}
select(flights,ends_with("_time"),ends_with("_delay"),-c(sched_arr_time,sched_dep_time,air_time))
```
